This simple chat app communicates in the local loop. This is an experimental prototype. 
Internet Comm. using TCP sockets was the main idea. But I scrapped that plan since, tunneling and other routing configurations and inconsistences can be a real pain in the a**! Hence I decided to release a working prototype
that can comm. within an intranet (LAN). You can modify ip address/port from the source!
